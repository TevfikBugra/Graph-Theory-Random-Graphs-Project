# Graph-Theory-Random-Graphs-Project
In this project, random graphs and random graph generation processes are discussed.
Concept of random graph generation, its history and the contributors of this topics throughout 
the history are introduced. The two algorithms, Havel-Hakimi and Sequential Algorithm 
(proposed by Blitzstein and Diaconis) are shown and discussed. The algorithms are tested 
and compared according to their running times. Furthermore, a connectivity and m/n ratio 
analysis are conducted.
