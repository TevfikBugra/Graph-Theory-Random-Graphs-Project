# Graph-Theory-Random-Graphs-Project
In this project, random graphs and random graph generation processes are discussed.
Concept of random graph generation, its history and the contributors of this topics throughout 
the history are introduced. The two algorithms, Havel-Hakimi and Sequential Algorithm 
(proposed by Blitzstein and Diaconis [1]) are shown and discussed. The algorithms are tested 
and compared according to their running times. Furthermore, a connectivity and m/n ratio 
analysis are conducted. 
Blitzstein and Diaconis introduced an algorithm for generating random graphs from a graphical 
degree sequence, which is tested using the Erdos-Gallai Graphicality Test, in their paper [1]. 
They also proposed that the algorithm they introduced never gets stuck, and they provided a 
proof for this proposition. The proof is not examined in this study; however, the experimental 
results do not contradict with the proof.
